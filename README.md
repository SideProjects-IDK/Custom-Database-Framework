# Custom-Database-Framework

A custom (little) Framework built for creating and managing custom databases and objects.

## Motivation

Creating and managing databases can often be complex and tedious, especially when you need a lightweight solution. This framework aims to simplify the process of handling custom databases, making it easier for developers to create and manipulate data without the overhead of larger database management systems.

## Idea And Development Process

The framework was developed with the goal of providing a straightforward way to manage custom databases. The development process involved several key steps:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Understanding the needs of potential users and defining the core functionalities.
2. **Designing the Architecture**: Creating a modular architecture that allows for easy extension and maintenance.
3. **Implementation**: Writing the core components of the framework while ensuring code quality and readability.
4. **Testing**: Implementing unit tests to ensure the framework functions as expected and handling edge cases.
5. **Documentation**: Writing comprehensive documentation to help users understand and utilize the framework effectively.

## Features

- **Custom Object Management**: Easily create and manage custom objects within the database.
- **Simple API**: A straightforward API that allows for quick database operations without deep learning curves.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource requirements, making it suitable for small projects or embedded systems.

## Installation

To install the Custom-Database-Framework, simply clone the repository and include the framework files in your project:

```sh ~$ git clone https://github.com/SideProjects-IDK/Custom-Database-Framework.git```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use the Custom-Database-Framework:

```csharp
// Import the framework
import DatabaseFramework;

// Create a new database instance
Database db = new Database("myDatabase");

// Create a new object
MyObject obj = new MyObject("exampleData");

// Add the object to the database
db.addObject(obj);

// Retrieve the object
MyObject retrievedObj = db.getObject(obj.id);
```
